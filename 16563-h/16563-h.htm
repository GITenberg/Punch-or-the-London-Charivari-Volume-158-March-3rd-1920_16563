  OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>A lunatic who recently escaped from an asylum was eventually
  recaptured in a large dancing-hall in the West-End. The fact that he was
  waltzing divinely and keeping perfect time with the music aroused the
  other dancers' suspicions and led to his recapture.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The latest type of Tank, Mr. <font class="sc">Winston Churchill</font>
  informed the House of Commons, weighs thirty tons and can pass over a
  brick without crushing it. It is said to be modelled on the Profiteering
  Act.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The proposal of the <font class="sc">Home Secretary</font> to add
  fifty per cent. to taxi-cab fares and abolish the initial charge of
  sixpence is said to find favour both with owners and drivers. The men in
  particular have always chafed at the necessity of messing about with
  small silver.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Much sympathy is felt locally for the man who in the excitement caused
  by the declaration of the poll at Paisley lost his corkscrew.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The ex-Kaiser was responsible for the War," says the <i>Kölnische
  Zeitung</i>. Our Hush-hush Department seems to have grown very lax of
  late.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A welcome case of judicial sympathy is reported from West London. It
  appears that a Society lady charged with shop-lifting pleaded that she
  was the sole support of two kennel-ridden poodles, and was immediately
  discharged.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Press reports the existence of miles and miles of war-material in
  huge dumps near Calais and Boulogne. War Office officials, we hear, are
  greatly relieved, as they have been trying for several months to remember
  where they had left the stuff.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A lady with small capital would like to meet another similarly
  situated, with a view to the joint purchase of a reel of thread.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>At Jerusalem a tree has been uprooted whose fall is locally believed
  to presage the destruction of the Turkish Empire. It is only fair to the
  tree to point out that if it had known of this it would probably, like
  the Government, have changed its mind at the last minute.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"One of the problems of civilized humanity," says a writer in <i>The
  Daily Mail</i>, "is the avoidance of pain-producing elements in ordinary
  diet." Nowadays it is impossible to eat even so simple a thing as a
  boiled egg in a restaurant without the risk of being stung.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The identity of the gentleman who, under the initials "A.G.," recently
  advertised in the Press for the thyroid gland of <i>Proteus
  diplomaticus</i> remains unrevealed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It appears that the Government have undertaken not to engage in any
  more war with the Bolshevists, if they, for their part, will endeavour to
  quell the peace which is still raging.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Englishmen will never forget America," says a Service paper. For
  ourselves we had hoped that the American bacon affair was closed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A burglar broke into a barrister's chambers in the Temple last week.
  We understand that he got away without having any money taken off
  him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A woman who said she had had six husbands asked a London magistrate to
  grant her a separation. It is supposed that she is breaking up her
  collection.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Owing to the thick fog experienced in London, last week several
  daylight hold-ups were unavoidably postponed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>With the present fashion in ladies' wear many owners of beautiful
  brooches are in the unhappy position of having nothing to attach them
  to.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In order to raise funds for the building of a new church-porch in a
  Birmingham parish a member of the committee suggested the sale of small
  flags in the street. Struck by the originality of this novel idea the
  chairman agreed to go into the matter in order to see if it was
  practicable.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A farmer writing from Bridgnorth, Salop, to a daily paper states that
  he has a tame fox which guards the house at night and shepherds the sheep
  by day. We understand that the Dogs' Trade Union takes a serious view of
  the whole matter, but is not without hope of being able to avert a
  strike.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The real value of co-operation was illustrated the other day on the
  Underground Railway when a lady complained that a straphanger was
  standing on her foot. Word was immediately passed down the carriage, with
  the result that by a combined swaying movement in one direction the
  offender was enabled to remove his foot.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is estimated that three hundred and forty thousand persons made
  fortunes out of the War. Of these it is only fair to say that the number
  who actually encouraged the War to happen are few. The vast majority
  simply allowed it to come along and do its worst.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Corporation of London made £18 on the sale of waste paper in the
  year 1919-1920, as compared with over £9000 in the year 1918-1919. It
  looks as if in the last-named year the Corporation was in communication
  with a Government Department.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Why will not Scotsmen eat eels?" asks <i>The Manchester Guardian</i>.
  We cannot say, but we have always understood that the attitude is
  reciprocal.</p>

<h2>AUCTION IN THE SPACIOUS TIMES.</h2>

  <p>"It is Our Royal pleasure to will and declare one diamond," said the
  <font class="sc">Virgin Queen</font>, when the Keeper of the Privy Purse
  had arranged her hand for her. Sir <font class="sc">Walter
  Raleigh</font>, who sat on her left, was on his feet in a twinkling.
  "Like to like, 'twas ever thus," he murmured, bowing low to his
  Sovereign. "I crave leave to call two humble clubs, as becometh so mean a
  subject of Your Majesty," It is not known whether his allusion to the
  <font class="sc">Queen's</font> call was intended to refer to the diamond
  rings upon <font class="sc">Her Majesty's</font> fingers or to the
  scintillating glint in <font class="sc">Her Majesty's</font> eyes, but
  she inclined her head graciously in acknowledgment of his remarks before
  turning to her partner.</p>

  <p>"What say you, my Lord of <font class="sc">Leicester</font>?" she
  asked. "Wilt support a poor weak woman?" His Lordship, however, looked
  down his noble nose and said nothing for quite a long time. He found
  himself, to use a vulgar phrase, in the <i>consommé</i>. His hand
  contained the ace, king and six other spades, nothing to write home about
  in hearts or clubs, and one small diamond. To take from his partner the
  right to play the hand would be the act of a fool&mdash;the mere thought
  made him raise a hand to his neck as though to assure himself of its
  continuity. Even failure to support her call would be looked on as
  ungallant, if nothing worse.</p>

  <p>"How now, sirrah? Art sleeping in Our presence?" prompted the <font
  class="sc">Queen</font> sharply.</p>

  <p>The <font class="sc">Earl</font> swallowed noisily once or twice, just
  to show that he was awake, and then plunged.</p>

  <p>"An it please you, Madam, two diamonds," he muttered, with but a sorry
  show of his habitual arrogance.</p>

  <p>"Double!" said Sir <font class="sc">Francis Drake</font> in crisp
  seamanlike tones, whereat the Earl of <font class="sc">Leicester</font>
  was seen to fumble for the hilt of his rapier.</p>

  <p>"Stay, my Lord," his liege commanded; "'tis true the Knight hath left
  his manners in Devonshire, or on the Spanish main mayhap, but keep your
  brawl for an hour and place more fitting. We redouble."</p>

  <p>A momentary silence followed the <font class="sc">Queen's</font>
  discourse, cut short by the uncouth ejaculation "'Ods fish!" which
  escaped from Sir <font class="sc">Francis</font> apparently without his
  consent. He embarked on an apology at once, based on the fact that he was
  but an honest sailor; but, meeting with no encouragement, he gave it up
  and fell to sucking his teeth.</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Walter</font> meanwhile made good use of the
  interval to perfect a flower of speech signifying, in a manner worthy a
  courtier of his reputation, that he was content. His effort drew from the
  <font class="sc">Queen</font> a glance as nearly approaching the "glad
  eye" as any that august spinster was ever known to dispense. The Laird of
  Kenilworth announced that he also was content; but historians should
  accept the statement with reserve. Sir <font class="sc">Francis</font>
  either wasn't sure whether the rules of the game allowed him to double
  again, or else had just enough tact not to do so. The game then
  proceeded.</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Walter</font> led the ace of clubs. The
  appearance of the noble lord's solitary little diamond, as he laid down
  his hand, was greeted by a loud hiccough from the old salt, and the <font
  class="sc">Queen</font> herself was only saved from swooning by the
  timely administrations of a page with a flask of sal-volatile.</p>

  <p>When, fourth in hand, she trumped the honest sailor's ace, her partner
  had the hardihood to make conventional inquiry as to whether she had any
  clubs. <font class="sc">Her Majesty</font> uttered in reply the one
  dreadful word, "Treason," thus avoiding with true statesmanship any
  direct answer to the question, and indicating clearly her opinion of his
  two-diamond call. The Keeper of the Privy Purse shot out a lean hand and
  gathered in the trick.</p>

  <p>With the help of the ace of spades in dummy, the ace of hearts in her
  own hand, and a discriminating use of her Royal prerogative in the matter
  of following suit, all went well until the odd trick had been won. After
  that, however, Sir <font class="sc">Francis</font>, who had not doubled
  without good reason, proceeded to deal out six diamonds, led by the ace,
  king and queen. His partner unwisely allowed his feelings to get the
  better of him. "As <font class="sc">Will Shakspeare</font> hath it," he
  observed with unction, "'now is the winter of our discontent made
  glorious summer&mdash;'" but stopped on a sudden, with ears and scalp
  twitching horribly.</p>

  <p>"Ho without! Summon the guard!" roared the last of the Tudors, and
  immediately an N.C.O. and six private beef-eaters appeared on the scene.
  "Convey Our compliments to the Governor of the Tower," she continued,
  addressing the N.C.O., "and bid him confine the Earl of <font
  class="sc">Leicester</font> during Our pleasure. My Lord," she added,
  turning to her luckless partner, "'twere well, methinks, you should have
  leisure in which to reflect on the folly of trifling with a woman."</p>

  <p>It is greatly to the <font class="sc">Earl's</font> credit that at
  this point he made strenuous endeavours to surrender his sword in
  accordance with the drill-book, but as it refused to come out of its
  scabbard he was obliged to unbutton the frog from his belt and hand over
  the weapon complete with leather gear. This formality achieved, he was
  led away to durance vile.</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Francis</font>, poor fellow, fared scarcely
  better than the Earl. "Begone to sea, Sir Knight," hissed the <font
  class="sc">Queen</font>; "mayhap the Dons will teach you more becoming
  manners. Begone, I say, and look to 't your ships return not empty, else
  shall you not receive payment of your winnings."</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Francis</font> went.</p>

  <p>A glance at the pitiable condition of Sir <font
  class="sc">Walter</font> caused <font class="sc">Her Majesty's</font>
  heart to soften somewhat. "Come, Sir," she cooed, "an arm, prithee, and
  We will seek a place where you may read to Us the mummings of this
  strange bard, <font class="sc">Will Shakspeare</font>."</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Walter</font> at once regained control of his
  nerve-centres and escorted <font class="sc">Her Majesty</font> from the
  painful scene.</p>

<h2>GEORGE AND THE COW-DRAGON.</h2>

  <p>The "rockerty-tockerty-tock" refrain of the carriage-wheels below me
  changed into a jarring whine as the train came to a full stop. I looked
  out on a dim-lit platform which seemed to be peopled only by a squad of
  milk-cans standing shoulder to shoulder like Noah's Ark soldiers.</p>

  <p>As the engine shrieked and plunged into its collar again the door was
  jerked open and a man projected himself into the carriage and, opening
  the window so that the compartment was flooded with cold air, leaned out
  and resumed his conversation with a friend till the train bore him out of
  shouting range. He then pulled up the window, trod on my foot, sat on my
  lap and eventually came to rest on the seat opposite me.</p>

  <p>It was a small man, red of head and bright of eye. He wore his cap at
  the back of his head, so as to exhibit to an admiring world a
  carefully-cultured curl of the "quiff" variety, which was plastered
  across his forehead with a great expenditure of grease. His tie was a
  ready-made bow of shot-colours, red, green, blue and purple, and from his
  glittering watch-chain hung many fanciful medals, like soles upon a
  line.</p>

  <p>"Brother-in-law to me," he remarked, jerking his thumb towards the
  back-rushing lights of Exeter.</p>

  <p>"Who?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"That young feller I was talking to just now. Didn't you see me
  talking to a young feller?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I believe I did hear you talking to somebody."</p>

  <p>"Well, him. Married a sister to me, so he's my brother-in-law, ain't
  he?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"Well, you're wrong then. He's only a half-brother-in-law, because she
  is only a half-sister to me, her ma marrying my old man. Understand?"</p>

  <p>I said I did and pulled up my rug as a signal that I was going to
  sleep and the conversation was at an end.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, whatever he is, he's good enough for her."</p>

  <p>I remarked that that was most satisfactory and closed my eyes.</p>

  <p>He drew out a yellow packet of cigarettes, selected one and held them
  in my direction. I declined and again closed my eyes.</p>

  <p>"Very good, please yourself, it's one more for little Willie. All I
  can say is that you're foolish not taking a good fag when it don't cost
  you nothing. You don't catch me refusing a free fag even when I don't
  want to smoke. I takes it and puts it in my cap for when I do. Pounds
  I've saved that way, pounds and pounds."</p>

  <p>He lit his limp tube of paper and mystery, stamped out the match and
  spat deliberately on the floor.</p>

  <p>"See me do that?"</p>

  <p>I nodded with as much disgust as I could contrive.</p>

  <p>"Know what them notices say I can get for that? Fined or
  imprisoned."</p>

  <p>He paused for me to marvel at his daring.</p>

  <p>"Think I'm mad to take risks like that, don't cher? Well, I aren't
  neither. They couldn't catch me out, not they."</p>

  <p>He brushed some ash off his lap on to mine and winked sagely.</p>

  <p>"Suppose the guard was to come in here and start fining and
  imprisoning me for it, do you know what I'd do? I'd swear <i>you</i> did
  it."</p>

  <p>"But I should deny it," I retorted hotly.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span>

  <p>"Of course you would, old chum, and I shouldn't blame you neither, but
  you wouldn't stand no chance against me"&mdash;he leaned forward and
  tapped me on the knee as though to emphasize his words&mdash;"<i>I could
  lie your life away</i>."</p>

  <p>He sank back in his seat, his face aglow with conscious superiority.
  The clamour of the wheels increased as if they were live things burning
  with the fever of some bloodthirsty hunt.</p>

  <p>"Firing her up," said the red man; "always racing time, these
  passenger wagons. It's a dog's life and no blooming error." He prodded my
  foot with his. "I said 'it's a dog's life and no error.'"</p>

  <p>"What is?" I growled.</p>

  <p>"Engine-driving, of course. I'm on the road myself. Goods-pushing just
  now, but I've been on the expresses off and on, though it don't suit
  me&mdash;too much flaring hurry."</p>

  <p>He rattled off into technicalities of his trade, embroidered with
  tales of hair-bristling adventures and escapes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, old chum, there's more in our trade than what most fat-headed
  passengers thinks. As long as an accident don't occur they don't know
  what trouble we've been to avoiding of it. I've a good mind to give 'em a
  smash-up now and again just to teach 'em gratitood. F'instance, me and me
  mate was running a local down Ilfracombe way last week when what d'you
  think we runned into?"</p>

  <p>"Ilfracombe?" I hazarded sleepily.</p>

  <p>"An old cow! Now what d' you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"It was so much the worse for the coo," I quoted.</p>

  <p>"What say?"</p>

  <p>"It was so much the worse for the cow."</p>

  <p>"Worse for the cow?"</p>

  <p>"So <font class="sc">George Stephenson</font> said, and he invented
  the locomotive and ought to know, you'll admit."</p>

  <p>The little man stared at me, his mouth open; for once he seemed bereft
  of words. We had slowed to a momentary stop, in a small station and
  pulled out again before he regained control of his tongue, then he broke
  loose.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't admit it neither. I don't care if your friend George
  invented the moon, he talks like a fool, and you can tell him so from
  me."</p>

  <p>"I can't, unfortunately; he's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A chap that talks disrespectful and ignorant of cows like that didn't
  oughter be allowed to live. A cow is one of the worstest things you can
  run up against. I'd rather run into a row of brick houses than one of
  them nasty leathery old devils; and you can hand the information to your
  chum George."</p>

  <p>"I tell you I can't; he's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ask any driver or fireman on the road, and if he don't slip you one
  with a shovel for your withering ignorance he'll tell you just what I'm
  telling you now. Yes, you and your funny friend."</p>

  <p>"Look here, <font class="sc">George Stephenson</font> has
  been&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let your funny friend try running into a cow just for 'speriment.
  Just let him try it once. They tangle up in your bogies, all slippery
  bones and hide, slither along with you a yard or two, and the next thing
  you know is you're over an embankment and your widder is putting in for
  insurance. Tell your pal George from me."</p>

  <p>The brakes ground on and the lights of a station flickered past the
  windows.</p>

  <p>"My gosh!" exclaimed the red-headed man, springing to his feet, "this
  is Cullumpton, and I ought to have got out at the station before." He
  wrestled with the door-handle. "And it's all through sitting here
  listening to your everlasting damfool chatter about you and your friend
  George."</p>

  <p>"Who died forty years before I was born," said I. "Good night."</p>

<h2>WIZARDS: KLINGSOR AND ANOTHER.</h2>

  <p>"Another <i>Parsifal</i> ought to be written from the angle of
  Klingsor, who was an enlightened Arabian, physician, scientist and
  probably Aristotelian.... The Knights, and Wagner with them, call him a
  wizard, which was a crude mediæval way of 'slanging' any man who
  preferred knowledge to superstition."</p>

  <p>This remarkable utterance by the musical critic of <i>The Daily
  Mail</i> in the issue of February 25th has created a sensation in the
  political world fully equal to that caused by the announcement of Mr.
  <font class="sc">Asquith's</font> return for Paisley. Scientific and
  artistic circles have also been deeply moved.</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Philip Sassoon</font>, Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd
  George's</font> new secretary, interviewed by our representative, said
  that the tribute to his chief was all the more welcome considering its
  source. His only criticism was that, instead of calling the charge of
  wizardry a "crude mediæval" mode of invective, he should prefer to style
  it an ultra-modern application of the art of obloquy.</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Oliver Lodge</font>, in a wireless message from
  New York, entirely approved of <i>The Daily Mail's</i> reading of <font
  class="sc">Klingsor's</font> character. He was clearly a scientist and a
  spiritualist of remarkable attainments. The defection of <i>Kundry</i> to
  the side of the Knights was a sad instance&mdash;but not without modern
  parallels&mdash;of the unrelenting pressure exerted on weak women by the
  zealots of orthodoxy.</p>

  <p>Mr. A.B. <font class="sc">Walkley</font> said that he had long
  suspected <font class="sc">Klingsor</font> of being a
  crypto-Aristotelian, but the arguments of the writer in <i>The Daily
  Mail</i> had converted his suspicion to a certainty. He proposed to deal
  with the matter more fully in an imaginary dialogue between <font
  class="sc">Klingsor</font> and Sir <font class="sc">Oswald Stoll</font>
  (who was a devout follower of <font class="sc">Herbert Spencer</font>)
  which would shortly appear in <i>The Times</i>.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Devant</font> professed himself delighted with
  the vindication of <font class="sc">Klingsor</font>, who was undoubtedly,
  like <font class="sc">Roger Bacon</font>, a first-rate conjurer, far in
  advance of his time, and with limited resources was yet capable of
  producing illusions which would not have disgraced the stage of St.
  George's Hall.</p>

  <p>The Archbishop of <font class="sc">Canterbury</font> excused himself
  from pronouncing a definite opinion on the subject, but pointed out that
  it would doubtless come within the purview of the inquiry into
  Spiritualism undertaken by high clerical authority.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Jacob Epstein</font> made the gratifying
  announcement that he was engaged on a colossal statue of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lloyd George</font> in the character of the modern
  <i>Merlin</i>. His treatment might not commend itself to the leaders of
  Nonconformity in Wales, but his own artistic conscience was clear, and he
  felt he could count on the benevolent sympathy of the Northcliffe
  Press.</p>

  <p>The Editor of <i>The Times</i> strongly demurred to the statement that
  <font class="sc">Klingsor</font> was an Arabian. The great authority on
  <font class="sc">Klingsor</font> was the anonymous thirteenth-century
  epic poem on <i>Lohengrin</i>, the father of <i>Parsifal</i>, and he had
  no doubt (1) that the author was either a Czecho-Slovak or a Yugo-Slav;
  (2) that <font class="sc">Klingsor</font>, as the etymology suggested,
  was of the latter race. In these circumstances the attempt to establish
  an affinity between Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font> and <font
  class="sc">Klingsor</font> was nothing short of an outrage, which might
  have disastrous results on our relations with the new States of Central
  Europe.</p>

  <p>Mr. J. <font class="sc">Maynard Keynes</font> observed that the
  characterisation of Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font>, implicit in
  the defence of <font class="sc">Klingsor</font> made by the musical
  critic of <i>The Daily Mail</i>, indirectly confirmed his own
  impressions. It was true that the <font class="sc">Premier</font> did not
  physically resemble an Arab sheikh, and his knowledge of medicine,
  science or philosophy, to say nothing of geography, was decidedly jejune,
  but the sad case of President <font class="sc">Wilson</font> made it all
  too clear that he was capable of exerting a hypnotic influence on his
  colleagues. Mr. <font class="sc">Keynes</font> did not think Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lloyd George</font> was an Aristotelian; he preferred to
  consider him an unconscious Pragmatist. This view he proposed to develop
  in his forthcoming volume on the Subliminal Conscience of
  Nonconformity.</p>

<h2>SUZANNE'S BANKING ACCOUNT.</h2>

  <p>"These want paying," said Suzanne as she bounced into my nominally
  sacred den at a strictly prohibited hour. Therewith she thrust a
  <i>dossier</i> of tradesmen's bills into my feebly-resisting hands, and
  bang went an idea I had been tenderly nursing since breakfast.</p>

  <p>"But I can't spend the rest of the morning writing cheques," I
  protested. "I'm engaged just now on a most important article."</p>

  <p>"With your eyes shut," commented Suzanne, stooping to a grossly unfair
  insinuation. "I must tell Cook to make the breakfast coffee stronger in
  future; then you might manage to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Suzanne, you've been married to me long enough to know my
  methods of work. I can't begin an article until I've got the whole thing
  shaped in my mind, and to do that I must shut out everything else."</p>

  <p>"Especially your wife, I suppose. Well, I won't stay. You've got all
  the bills there; but don't start writing the cheques till you've got them
  well shaped in your mind."</p>

  <p>"But what on earth does all this mass of accounting literature
  represent?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"For the benefit of new readers a synopsis is attached," said Suzanne.
  "They're mostly small items; for instance, Madame Pillby&mdash;she's the
  little dressmaker round the corner, you know; though why an all-British
  spinster should call herself 'Madame' I can't
  imagine&mdash;five-and-fourpence-ha'penny."</p>

  <p>"Suzanne; I will <i>not</i> write a cheque for
  five-and-fourpence-ha'penny! Are they all like that?"</p>

  <p>"The biggest is two guineas; that's what it cost to have my last
  dance-hat altered to your specifications, because you said it tickled
  your nose. There are seventeen of them in all&mdash;bills, not hats;
  total, twelve pounds fifteen shillings and elevenpence three farthings,
  pa-pa."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I'm going to do," I said. "I'm going to advertise
  in the Personal Columns of the papers that I will not be responsible for
  payment of any debts incurred by my wife under the sum of one pound.
  That'll stop this half-crown cheque nuisance. Why don't you go out and
  buy yourself a packet of assorted postal-orders?"</p>

  <p>"I did once; but I got in with a nice long list just before
  closing-time, and there was very nearly a riot on both sides of the
  counter."</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow, this sort of thing has got to stop; I can't waste all
  the morning settling your miserable little bills. What we'll do is this:
  you shall have your own banking-account, and in future you can write your
  own cheques&mdash;as long as the Bank will stick it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, how perfectly splendid!" cried Suzanne. "I've always wanted to
  have a cheque-book of my own, but Father thought it unsexing. Do let's go
  and take out the licence at once."</p>

  <p>The precious hour of fertilisation was already wasted, so there and
  then I escorted Suzanne to the Bank. At my demand we were ushered into
  the Manager's room, where we were received with a courtesy only too
  obviously tempered by the suspicion that I had come to suggest an
  overdraft. On my explaining our errand, however, the Manager's features
  relaxed their tenseness, and as I wrote the cheque that brought Suzanne's
  account into a sordid world he even attempted a vein of fatherly
  benediction.</p>

  <p>"Now we shall require a specimen of the lady's signature," he said as
  he produced an amazingly obese ledger and indicated where Suzanne was to
  sign her name. "Remove the glove, please," he added hastily.</p>

  <p>"Just like old times in the vestry," said Suzanne to me in a whisper.
  Then she wrote her name&mdash;"Suzanne Désirée <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span> Beverley
  Trumpington-Jones"&mdash;all of it. By the time she had finished she had
  trespassed into several columns reserved for entirely different uses. The
  Manager surveyed the effect with consternation.</p>

  <p>"Rather a long name, isn't it?" he asked diffidently. "I was only
  wondering if our cheque-forms would accommodate it all."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not really responsible for it all," she replied. "The
  Trumpington-Jones part is the more or less permanent result of a serious
  accident when I was little more than a child. But I might shorten it a
  bit. I sometimes answer to the name of Soozles, but I suppose that would
  only do for really intimate cheques. How would 'S. Beverley T.-Jones' do?
  I shouldn't like to lose the 'Beverley' as it's a kind of family
  heirloom, and I always use it, even when I'm writing to the sweep."</p>

  <p>I edged away to the window and left them to settle the signature
  question among themselves.</p>

  <p>"And what kind of cheques would you like&mdash;'Order' or 'Bearer'?" I
  next heard the Manager asking.</p>

  <p>"Show me some patterns, please," commanded Suzanne.</p>

  <p>On the wall was a frame containing a number of different cheque
  varieties, to which her attention was directed.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you any other colours?" she asked. "I thought a
  black-and-yellow cheque would be rather becoming; but don't bother about
  it if it's not in stock."</p>

  <p>She ended by taking one book of blue and one of purple cheques, and
  with these and a paying-in-book (which she said would do so nicely for
  spills) we at last departed. From behind the closed door of the private
  office I distinctly heard a prolonged sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>A few days later I came upon Suzanne sitting at her writing-table and
  examining a cheque with a mystified air.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know," she replied. "I sent Angela this cheque the
  other day to pay for my ticket for the Law-Courts' Revel, and she says
  the Bank people have returned it to her. And it's marked 'R.D.' in red
  ink. Who is 'R.D.'?"</p>

  <p>"He's the gentleman who censors cheques; and he has a way of
  disqualifying them when there's not enough cash to pay them. Suzanne,
  what have you done with all that money I paid into your account last
  Monday?"</p>

  <p>"But I've only paid those footling little bills. There must be tons of
  money left, unless the Bank's been speculating with it."</p>

  <p>"Let me have a look at that cheque," I said.</p>

  <p>She handed it to me and I examined it carefully.</p>

  <p>"I see it's signed 'Thine, Suzanne.'"</p>

  <p>"But that's how I always sign myself to Angela," she said; "and the
  Manager distinctly told me to use my customary signature."</p>

  <p>"Signature&mdash;not signatures," I explained gently. "They're rooted
  in convention at the Bank and can't bear the least approach to variety.
  And what's this scribbled on the back of it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's only a note I dashed off to Angela telling her what I was
  going to wear. It seemed such a pity to waste a sheet of notepaper when
  there was all that space to spare."</p>

  <p>I gave her a quarter-of-an-hour's lesson in the art of drawing
  cheques. Then I took up the paying-in book which was lying on the table.
  I knew it ought to be in a virgin state as I had added nothing to the
  entrance money. "And what might all these figures portend?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Those? Oh, that's baby's weight-chart. I'm always going to keep it
  there."</p>

  <p>Well, well, if Suzanne looks after the weighing-in I can at least
  control the paying-in. And I left it at that.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

  <p><i>Monday, February 23rd.</i>&mdash;The Highland Fling involves, I
  understand, some complicated figures, but it is nothing to the Lowland
  Reel (<font class="sc">Coats</font>' variety), on which subject Sir <font
  class="sc">Auckland Geddes</font> was rather badly heckled this
  afternoon. A suggestion that Messrs. <font class="sc">Coats</font> might
  use the profits of their foreign trade to reduce the price to the home
  consumer drove the harassed Minister into an unconscious <i>mot</i>.
  "Suppose," he said, "they cut the thread ... where should we be
  then?"</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/164-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/164-1.png"
      alt="THE TANK AND THE LITTLE BRICK." /></a>
    THE TANK AND THE LITTLE BRICK.

    <p class="center">(<font class="sc">Mr. Churchill and Captain Wedgwood
    Benn</font>.)</p>

    <p>"The tank, weighing thirty tons, is able to pass over a brick lying
    on the road without crushing it. This is a very important
    point."&mdash;<i>Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill</font></i>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Charles Palmer</font>, the well-known
  <i>Globe</i>-trotter, has just completed a remarkable journey. Within the
  space of a few weeks he has traversed the distance from the Press Gallery
  to the Floor of the Chamber, going round by the Wrekin. During the last
  stage of the route the intrepid traveller was accompanied by Sir <font
  class="sc">Henry Dalziel</font> and Mr. <font
  class="sc">Bottomley</font>.</p>

  <p>In introducing a Vote on Account of the Army for a trifle of
  seventy-four millions the <font class="sc">War Minister</font> proudly
  announced that Britain and Germany were the only countries in the world
  that had abolished conscription&mdash;and Germany's action was not
  exactly voluntary.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill's</font> description of a new tank, so
  fast that it could outstrip a foxhound "over a country," so cool that
  even in the tropics its crew would preserve their <i>sangfroid
  traditionnel</i>, and so delicately sprung that it could run over a brick
  without hurting itself&mdash;or the brick&mdash;momentarily encouraged
  the belief that here was the weapon to make war impossible. But almost in
  the same breath Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill</font> stated that
  simultaneously the War Office had invented a rifle grenade which would
  put the super-tank out of action. "As you were!"</p>

  <p>Criticism was not entirely disarmed. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Devlin</font> of course talked of Ireland&mdash;"the only
  country with which the Empire is at war to-day;" and little Capt. <font
  class="sc">Wedgwood Benn</font> rebuked Mr. <font
  class="sc">Churchill</font> for his unfilial sneer at "pious America,"
  and was himself advised "not to develop more indignation than he could
  contain."</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, February 24th.</i>&mdash;In both Houses the new policy of
  the Allies in regard to Soviet Russia was unfolded. The gist of it is
  that they will not enter into diplomatic relations with the Bolshevist
  Government until it is ready to adopt civilised methods, but in the
  meantime will heartily encourage trade with Russia. It would seem that
  the practical genius of our race has once more discovered a means of
  indulging sentiment without interfering with business.</p>

    THE LABOUR LORD CHANCELLOR.

    <p class="center"><i>A forecast.</i></p>

    <p class="center"><font class="sc">Lord Haldane.</font></p>
  </div>
  <p>Lord <font class="sc">Birkenhead</font> (not <font
  class="sc">Brokenhead</font>, by the way, as the <i>Cork
  Constitution</i>, inadvertently or not, calls him) chaffed <font
  class="sc">Lord Haldane</font> on his "How Happy could I be with Either"
  attitude between Liberalism and Labour, and advised him definitely to be
  off with the old love and on with the new, in order that when Labour came
  into its own the Woolsack might be adequately filled.</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Alfred Mond</font> did not allow himself to be
  perturbed by the description of certain pictures in the Imperial War
  Museum as "freaks" and "libels," for he had observed "with some
  astonishment" that most of the art critics had pronounced them to be very
  fine works of art. But when Mr. <font class="sc">Jeremiah MacVeagh</font>
  asked if some of these pictures were not portraits of Cabinet Ministers,
  "and if so how can they possibly be works of art?" the First
  Commissioner's artistic conscience was stirred, and compelled him to give
  the questioner a little instruction in first principles. "Whether a
  portrait is a work of art depends," he pointed out, "on the artist and
  not on the subject painted."</p>

  <p>The evening was devoted to drink. Sir <font class="sc">John
  Rees</font>, who urged the abolition of all wartime restrictions, would
  have been more effective, perhaps, if he had not striven so hard to be
  lively. One of his sallies, evoked by the impending <i>début</i> of Lady
  <font class="sc">Astor</font> as a Parliamentary orator, was indeed, as
  she observed, "more than polite."</p>

  <p>She herself had her moments of gaiety, but was best, I thought, when
  seriously arguing for the continuance of the restrictions on alcohol in
  the special interests of women.</p>

  <p>I am afraid, however, that the unregenerate were more intrigued by Mr.
  <font class="sc">Carr's</font> claim that the Carlisle experiment <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span> had
  been a great success&mdash;"it was the only city in the country in which
  a man could buy a bottle of whisky to take home."</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, February 25th.</i>&mdash;Question-time in the Commons
  was dominated by the news that Mr. <font class="sc">Asquith</font> was in
  for Paisley, and Members were more concerned in discussing the effect of
  his return upon the Government and Opposition than in listening to
  Ministerial replies. Sir <font class="sc">Donald Maclean</font> was "all
  smiles" over his approaching release from the responsibilities of
  leadership; but Mr. <font class="sc">Hogge</font>, I thought, looked
  rather like <i>Mrs. Gummidge</i> when "thinking of the old 'un."</p>

  <p>A nod from Mr. <font class="sc">Macpherson</font> and the Government
  of Ireland Bill was formally and silently introduced&mdash;strange
  contrast to the long debates and exciting scenes that attended the birth
  of the Bill's three predecessors in 1886, 1893 and 1912.</p>

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Robert Horne</font> explained with his usual
  clarity and persuasiveness the new Unemployment Insurance Bill. The
  debate on it was interrupted to allow the discussion of a motion by Sir
  J. <font class="sc">Remnant</font> advocating the increase of police
  pensions to meet the present cost of living. The police are, with good
  reason, very popular with the House. In vain the <font class="sc">Home
  Secretary</font> pointed out that the Government even in this cause did
  not feel justified in "out-running the constable." Forgetting all their
  recent zeal for economy Members trooped into the Bobbies' Lobby and beat
  the Government by 123 to 57.</p>

    <p>"Whether a portrait is a work of art depends on the artist and not
    on the subject painted."&mdash;<i>Sir A. <font class="sc">Mond</font>
    on the Imperial War Museum Pictures</i>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>The idea that Irishmen, however much they may dislike British rule,
  never miss an opportunity of raiding the British Treasury, has received a
  rude shock. Captain <font class="sc">Redmond</font>, inquiring about the
  allocation of a sum of a quarter-of-a-million for reconstruction in
  Ireland, was surprised to learn that ten thousand pounds had been
  allotted to his own constituency, but not claimed. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Devlin</font> supplied the key to the mystery: "The reason it
  was not asked for was because we did not know it was there."</p>

  <p>I learn from <i>Who's Who?</i> that the recreations of Sir <font
  class="sc">Alfred Mond</font> include "golf, motoring and all forms of
  sport." It must have been with keen regret, therefore, that he felt
  himself compelled to refuse facilities for cricket in Hyde Park, owing to
  the risk to the public. Viscount <font class="sc">Curzon</font> asked if
  cricket was more dangerous than inflammatory speeches. But the <font
  class="sc">First Commissioner</font>, speaking no doubt from personal
  experience, expressed the view that there was considerably more danger
  from a cricket-ball.</p>

  <p>The Opposition had rather bad luck on the Constantinople debate. If
  they had waited till Monday, as originally arranged, they could have
  trained their big gun from Paisley on to the Government entrenchments.
  Through insisting on the earliest possible date, they had to content
  themselves with the far lighter artillery of Sir <font class="sc">Donald
  Maclean</font>. Much, however, was hoped from Lord <font
  class="sc">Robert Cecil</font>, who was believed to be heavily charged
  with high explosives. But before he could come into range up jumped Sir
  <font class="sc">Edward Carson</font>, and in a few brief sentences
  pointed out that until the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> had
  told them the grounds for the decision to leave the Turk his capital, and
  the conditions under which he was to stay there, the House was talking in
  the air. Members thereupon clamoured for the <font class="sc">Prime
  Minister</font>, who accordingly had to make his defence when he had
  heard only half the indictment, and to expend most of the ammunition he
  had prepared for Lord <font class="sc">Robert</font>, including some
  remarkable specimens of the "deadly parallel," before receiving his
  adversary's fire.</p>

  <p>That in turn rather upset Lord <font class="sc">Robert's</font> plan
  of campaign, and he was not much more destructive than Sir <font
  class="sc">Donald Maclean</font> had been. The House as a whole seemed
  satisfied that the Allies had done their best with a problem for which
  there is no perfect solution, and that there was at least a chance that
  the <font class="sc">Sultan</font> would find the guns of an
  international fleet pointing at his palace windows a strong incentive to
  good behaviour.</p>

<h2>A FANCY BIRD.</h2>

  <p>When any friend of mine is in trouble I always make a point of writing
  and asking if there is anything I can do. As a rule, there isn't, but it
  is a satisfaction to me to know I have made the offer. When I heard that
  Filmer was leaving his spacious house and grounds at Hampstead, selling
  half his furniture and moving into a third storey flat at Battersea, I
  wrote at once. I received in reply one of his usual barely decipherable
  scrawls: "Yes, old dear, you might find a home for my raven; it's ancient
  and a bit rusty, but lots of life in it yet. I'm parting with all my
  garden things."</p>

  <p>I busied myself about the matter at once. When a man you have known
  and respected for years is driven by high prices and income-tax to vacate
  a beautiful home and asks such a simple thing of you as to find a shelter
  for his bird, you like to do your best. Personally I knew nothing of
  ravens, but I recognized the inadequacy of my garden for the
  accommodation of a bird of any kind, therefore I could not think of
  taking it. But I had a surface acquaintance with the owner of a carriage
  drive, and I approached him without delay. He was cold in his manner and
  said with so many calls upon him he could not see his way to contribute
  towards the expense of Filmer's move, although he had no doubt, from my
  representation, that it was a deserving case.</p>

  <p>The misunderstanding arose from my leading up to the object of my
  visit gradually instead of coming to the point at once and asking him to
  give a comfortable home to a raven. When I explained further he unbent
  and said he would think it over.</p>

  <p>Later he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re</i> <font class="sc">Raven</font>.</p>

  <p>"<font class="sc">Dear Sir</font>,&mdash;I have consulted an authority
  on this bird and find that its bad character has brought about its
  practical extinction in this country save in the mountain fastnesses of
  Wales and the craggy moors of Yorkshire. I also learn that its extended
  wings measure thirty-six inches on an average. I must decline to provide
  an asylum for such an extensive mass of depravity."</p>

  <p>I confess I was discouraged and also somewhat shocked. I felt Filmer
  should have enlightened me more on the characteristics of his
  <i>protégé</i>. The episode taught me to avoid preamble in my next quest
  for a domicile. Also I thought it only right to express myself with
  absolute frankness. The address of a lady with a reputation for <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span> a love
  of animals was given to me, and I hastened to call upon her. She answered
  the door herself.</p>

  <p>"Madam," I said, "may I ask you of your kind heart to give a home to
  an almost extinct bird of evil character about a yard across?"</p>

  <p>She looked startled for a moment and then quietly closed the door.</p>

  <p>I was still further discouraged. I felt bound in honour to comply, if
  possible, with Filmer's comparatively simple request. By chance I ran
  across Timberley, a man brimful of resource and suggestion. "You want a
  brewery," he said; "that's the <i>milieu</i> for a raven. To my mind no
  brewery is artistically complete without one. A raven hopping about the
  casks gives a <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, a <i>cachet</i>, to the premises.
  You should get an introduction to a manager."</p>

  <p>With some difficulty I did, and I waited upon him in his private
  office. He seemed immersed in business and asked me to be seated in such
  a brusque manner that I had no alternative but to remain standing.</p>

  <p>"I must apologise for trespassing upon your valuable time, but it has
  been suggested to me that no brewery is complete without a raven&mdash;"
  I began, stammering slightly from nervousness.</p>

  <p>"Well, we've got one. What about it?" he said.</p>

  <p>In face of this unlooked-for development I could do nothing but bow
  and retire.</p>

  <p>After this third failure to house the bird I threw convention to the
  winds and took to accosting utter strangers in the street with, "Will you
  have a raven?" I went rides in trams and tubes and canvassed the
  passengers. "Not to-day, thank you," was the response, save in a few
  instances. One man invited me to ask him again and he would do me in. A
  lady to whom I propounded the query as we were descending the moving
  staircase side by side precipitated herself forward with such haste that
  but for the intervening travellers she must have fallen headlong to the
  bottom. The mother of a family to whom I appealed shook her head politely
  and said she was obliged to me for the offer, but it was hard enough to
  pay for butcher's meat; she couldn't afford poultry.</p>

  <p>Then at last, all my efforts having failed, I reluctantly took my pen
  and wrote to Filmer. In reply I received another of his
  scrawls:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What's this about a raven? Don't let it grow on you. The Victory
  Croquet Club is taking my <font class="sc">Roller</font>, £7 carriage
  forward. I gave £3 10<i>s.</i> for it second-hand ten years ago.</p>

  <p>"N.B.&mdash;I had great difficulty in reading your writing. Don't
  cultivate illegibility; it's tiresome for your friends."</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"<font class="sc">John Ferguson.</font>"</p>

  <p>After the unsatisfying theatre-diet which has fallen to me of late I
  was doubly glad to get my teeth into Mr. St. <font class="sc">John
  Ervine's</font> good meaty ration at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. His
  theme is as old and new as Job. <i>John Ferguson</i> is a saintly Ulster
  farmer, apostle of the doctrine of non-resistance (rare type in those
  parts, I understand) and eager justifier of the ways of God to men.
  <i>Ferguson's</i> beloved farm is mortgaged; foreclosure imminent. Help
  is confidently expected from brother <i>Andrew</i> in America, but does
  not come. Daughter <i>Hannah</i>, sent with a message to the brutal
  mortgagee, is outraged by him. Prospective son-in-law <i>James</i>, man
  of great words but little heart, rushes into the night to kill the
  ravisher. But it is silent son <i>Andrew</i> (destined for the ministry)
  who does the killing, because he knows <i>James</i> to be a craven.</p>

  <p><i>John Ferguson</i> urges confidently the will of God that
  <i>James</i>, whom he believes blood-guilty, should not avoid arrest, and
  refuses to hide him. But when young <i>Andrew</i> insists on giving
  himself up to save <i>James</i> and his own peace the old man's faith,
  weakened, falters; he protests in his anguish, but rallies to accept this
  last blow from the hand of God&mdash;made none the easier to bear by the
  arrival, just a fatal fortnight late, of the money from his brother, a
  forgetful sort of man, who had mistaken the date of the mail. The tragic
  irony of the whole is skilfully heightened by the fact that it is
  half-witted "<i>Clutie</i>," with his penny whistle and his random words,
  who goads young <i>Andrew</i> to his vengeance.</p>

  <p>A grim tale finely (perhaps just a little too diffusely) told and
  admirably presented. Mr. <font class="sc">Ervine's</font> most effective
  stroke was, I think, the character of <i>James Cæsar</i>, with his
  pathetic yet revolting self-condemnation, interpreted with a real mastery
  of art without artifice by Mr. J.M. <font class="sc">Kerrigan</font>, of
  the old band of "Irish Players." Miss <font class="sc">Moyna
  MacGill</font> (a name new to me) played her <i>Hannah</i> with an
  exquisite sincerity and restraint. A particular moment when, from her
  hysterical laughter at the careful choice made by her father's God of the
  moment for the arrival of the money, she breaks into a passionate "It's
  not right! It's not just!" was very fine. The whole character was
  skilfully built up. The part by no means played itself.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Herbert Marshall's</font> <i>Andrew</i> was also
  an excellent performance. Was it quite right, however, that the morning
  after the murder he should appear so completely unruffled? (I admit I
  don't know my Ulster intimately). I rather think that Mr. <font
  class="sc">Miles Malleson's</font> well-studied "<i>Clutie</i>" might
  have been a little less coherent, with more fawning in his manner. He
  seemed something too normal for his purpose in the piece. The way in
  which the other characters staved off his piping was beyond all praise. I
  should guess, from specimens submitted, that his repertory was not
  extensive.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Rea</font>, as the father, was of course
  competent, but surely a little overplacid throughout. He accepted the
  blow of his daughter's dishonour with scarcely a sign that submission
  caused him any serious pang&mdash;a seeming indifference shared by Miss
  <font class="sc">Maire O'Neill</font> (<i>Hannah's</i> mother), who
  appeared quite untroubled a few minutes after the harrowing relation, and
  indeed seemed throughout to be playing too easily. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Raymond Valentine</font> had a "fat" part as the villain, and
  well and fatly he played it.</p>

  <p>I realise more than ever the difficulties of an Irish Settlement.</p>

<h2>FAME.</h2>

  <p>For a long time past I had felt that something ought to be done about
  it, and then one evening as I opened my paper in the Tube I came suddenly
  upon the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Lunching yesterday with Jack Poppington at the Bitz, where, by the
  way, M. Caramel treated us to a superbly priceless <i>mousse à la
  Canadienne</i>, he told me that his <i>Little Pests</i> is selling like
  wildfire and proving a real bonanza to the lucky publishers, Messrs.
  Painter and Lilley. Had a pleasant chat with him about old times in the
  Army Pay Corps, in which we served together for nearly sixteen months
  during one of the hottest periods of hostilities 'out yonder.' More
  famous amongst the general public for his black ribboned tortoiseshell
  monocle and invariable presence at all truly semi-smart Bohemian
  functions, Poppington keeps a brindled bulldog, grows primulas and is, of
  course, known to a select circle as the energetic Organising Secretary of
  the North Battersea Entomological Society."</p>

  <p>The letterpress which I have quoted above was headed "Popular Pap" and
  formed a kind of frame for a photograph of Mr. Poppington, which seemed
  to show that his luncheon at the Bitz had not really agreed with him
  after all, and at the bottom of the column I noted the familiar signature
  of "<i>Marchand du Beurre</i>."</p>

  <p>As usual when I read paragraphs of this kind I first of all blushed
  guiltily and glanced round to see whether anyone had noticed how eagerly
  I was drinking it all in. Then I put on the faint superior smile of
  recognition which I felt that the situation obviously demanded. Good old
  Poppington! One of the best. What recollections it stirred!
  <i>Marchand</i> and he and I&mdash;</p>

  <p>When I left the Tube I carefully crumpled the paper up and threw it
  away, and in the middle of dinner I took care to remark casually to
  Araminta, "By the way, I suppose you put <i>Little Pests</i> on the
  library list?"</p>

  <p>"Awfully sorry," she said, "but I'm afraid I hadn't heard of
  them."</p>

  <p>"Poppington's latest," I said curtly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I haven't heard of Poppington either."</p>

  <p>I gave a sigh of desperation and leant back in my chair.</p>

  <p>"Well, really!" I protested. "Surely the man
  himself&mdash;everybody&mdash;I mean&mdash;his&mdash;his
  eye-glass&mdash;his bulldog&mdash;of course only a few of us fully
  appreciate the extent of his actual research work&mdash;but
  still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, I'll get it," she replied.</p>

  <p>That finished off Araminta easily enough, but the situation none the
  less was serious. Paragraphs exactly like this had been meeting my eye in
  almost every popular paper for month after month, and, though I use two
  memory systems and have an electric scalp shampoo each week, I find them
  increasingly difficult to cope with. <i>Who's Which</i> already
  transgresses the established canons of literary art. It is almost as tall
  lying down as standing up, and fellows like Poppington are not even in
  <i>Who's Which</i>. He had not, you observed, even obtained an O.B.E.
  What would happen if I met him at some public gathering or dinner and by
  some awful mischance forgot those salient facts?</p>

  <p>It appeared to me that a process for reproducing short biographies of
  this nature in a slightly larger type on the shirt-fronts of eminent
  personages was badly needed; it should be coupled, I felt, with an
  arrangement of periscopes to help one when sitting beside the great man
  or standing behind his back. Or he might perhaps wear upon his sleeve
  something like the divisional signs which were so useful in France. Old
  Poppington, for instance, might have a&mdash;might wear an&mdash;I mean
  there might be something or other on his coat in red or green or blue to
  indicate the nature and scope of his secretarial activities and give a
  fellow the right lead. And to think that every week dozens and dozens of
  new Poppingtons are springing up like crocuses about me! It was a
  bewildering thought. They were becoming perhaps the most numerous and
  influential class in the community. I had visions of mass meetings of
  "well-known" men&mdash;"well-known" men marching in procession with flags
  to Downing Street to demand State recognition, statues and pensions, and
  insisting that it should be made a penal offence not to recognise their
  well-known features in the street. I made a great resolve. Why should I
  be left out of it? I determined to join the crowd.</p>

  <p>I had got rather out of touch with old <i>Marchand</i> for some time,
  and had indeed forgotten exactly what he looked like, but I persuaded a
  mutual friend to point him out to me, and, selecting the psychological
  moment, cannoned into him heavily in the street. His spectacles dropped
  off and his note-book fell out of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Why, if it isn't <i>Du Beurre</i>!" I shouted, feigning an ecstatic
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said rather stiffly, when he had recovered his
  breath, "but I am afraid I haven't the pleasure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am John Smith," I said.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Allow me to tell you all about myself," I said. And I did.</p>

  <p>I was a little nervous as to how he would take it, but the event
  justified me. When I opened my paper next evening I found the following
  words:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ran across John Smith of Ravenscourt Park yesterday afternoon.
  Chatting with him about one thing and another, he told me something of
  the methods he has employed to bring about his present celebrity in that
  salubrious suburb. He has never, it appears, written a book, collaborated
  in a review, appeared in a night-club, lunched at the Bitz, sat on a
  committee, or been summoned as a witness in a sensational divorce case.
  His record, I fancy, must be one of the most thoroughly unique in Greater
  London."</p>

  <p>There was no photograph of John Smith, but, biting partly into this
  paragraph and partly into another on the opposite side of the column, was
  one of Mortimer Despenser, the new film star, featured in <i>Scented
  Sin</i>, which really did almost as well. Dear old <i>Du Beurre</i>!</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>Undeniably Mr. <font class="sc">Caradoc Evans</font> is the bold boy.
  No doubt you remember (since they are so difficult to forget) the two
  volumes in which he dealt faithfully (and a bit over) with the manners of
  his countrymen in the land of their fathers. I have heard, and can well
  believe, that some of Mr. <font class="sc">Evans'</font> own people were
  moved by this tribute even to the extent of threatening its author with
  personal violence. And now he has turned from Welsh Wales to English
  London, and gives us in <i>My Neighbours</i> (<font
  class="sc">Melrose</font>) a further collection of sketches pleasantly
  calculated to prove that the general detestability of his compatriots
  remains unchanged by their migration from a whitewashed cottage to a
  villa in Suburbia. Whatever you may think of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Evans'</font> work, whether it attracts or violently repels,
  there can be no question of its devastating skill. His sketches, no more
  than a few pages in length, contain never an idle word, and the phrases
  bite like vitriol. Moreover he employs an idiom that is (I conjecture) a
  direct transcription from native speech, which adds enormously to the
  effect. Understand me, not for worlds would I commend these volumes
  haphazard to the fastidious; I only say they are clever, arresting and
  violently individual. Also that, if you have not so far met the work of
  Mr. <font class="sc">Evans</font>, here is your opportunity, in a volume
  that shows it at its best, or worst. Half-an-hour's reading will give you
  an excellent idea of it. At the end of that time you will probably send
  either to the chemist for a restorative or to the bookseller for the two
  previous volumes. Meanwhile, if I were the writer, I should purchase a
  bulldog.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mrs. <font class="sc">George Wemyss</font> has for some time past
  specialised in spinster-aunts, bachelor-uncles and charming nieces. In
  <i>Oranges and Lemons</i> (<font class="sc">Constable</font>) she
  introduces us pleasantly to some more. The plot, in fact, is chiefly
  concerned with the violent squabbles of an uncle and aunt, who belong to
  different sides of the family, for the good graces of <i>Diana</i> (who
  is nineteen, or thereabouts, and radiant), and <i>Shant</i>, (who says
  so&mdash;just like that&mdash;and is five). There are also several young
  men. To test his abilities in the <i>Admirable Crichton</i> line
  <i>Diana</i> maroons the most favoured of these, together with three
  other aspirants to her hand, and her bachelor uncle, on an island in a
  Scottish loch, hamperless, on a soft day. As the affections of all the
  lovers remain undimmed, you can guess what kind of a girl <i>Diana</i>
  must have been. <i>Shant's</i> even more responsible job is to tumble off
  a pony and allay the temporary tartness which existed between her two
  elderly admirers, so that nothing but oranges and orange-blossoms remain.
  Really, of course, none of the story much matters. But if you want the
  sensation of having stayed with delightful people in delightful places,
  where rising prices are not even mentioned or thought of, Mrs. <font
  class="sc">Wemyss</font> can give it you all the time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Night and Day</i> (<font class="sc">Duckworth</font>) is the title
  of <font class="sc">Virginia Woolf's</font> last book; but there is no
  night for the author's <span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"
  id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span> clarity of vision, or her cleverness in
  describing every detail she has seen, or her delicate precision of style;
  there is only daylight, temperate, pervading, but at times, I am afraid,
  almost irritatingly calm. "Give me one indiscretion of sympathy or
  emotion on behalf of your characters," the reader is tempted to implore
  her; "let me feel that you are a little bit excited about them and I
  shall feel excited too." The story, after all, is the simple one (to put
  it in the shudderingly crude language of former days) of a girl's change
  of heart from an unreal love to one of whose sincerity she eventually
  convinces herself. <i>Katharine Hilbery</i>, the granddaughter of a great
  poet, brought up by a father whose only interest is in literature, and a
  charming mother who wanders in fields of Victorian romance, breaks off
  her engagement with a civil servant who has more taste than talent for
  letters, and chooses instead a man slightly below her in social position,
  but with firmness and decision of character and genuine skill
  in&mdash;what? Ironmongery? No, literature. All through the book I found
  myself wondering whether a mind so finely tempered as <i>Katharine's</i>,
  a perception so acute, was really fitted for anything so commonplace as,
  after all, love is. And I longed for the authoress, who explained every
  mood so amazingly well, to explain this too.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mrs. <font class="sc">Norris</font> is evidently a specialist in
  unconventional situations. In her last novel her theme was the intrigue
  between a man and his step-mother. In <i>Sisters</i> (<font
  class="sc">Murray</font>) it is the passion of a man for his living
  wife's married sister, and in neither case does the author seem to be
  conscious of anything out of the ordinary. Not that there is any air of
  naughtiness about the business. <i>Peter</i>, a rich cripple, loved
  <i>Cherry</i>, the youngest and prettiest of the three <i>Strickland</i>
  girls. But <i>Martin</i>, a casual impecunious stranger, stepped in and
  took her in one bite before <i>Peter</i> could quite realise she was no
  longer a child. So in default he married <i>Alix</i>, who was,
  incidentally, worth six of her. Meeting his <i>Cherry</i>, disillusioned
  about an unsatisfactory and unsuccessful <i>Martin</i>, he reaches out
  his hand for this forbidden fruit. Whereupon <i>Alix</i>, the selfless,
  drives herself and <i>Martin</i> over a cliff by way of making things
  smooth for <i>Peter</i> and <i>Cherry</i>, which was inconsiderate, if
  resourceful; for, while <i>Alix</i> is happily killed, poor <i>Martin</i>
  only breaks his back, so that all may end with the balance on the credit
  side of the Recording Angel's ledger with <i>Cherry</i> nursing her
  hopeless invalid. An unlikely story, pleasantly and competently told.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>My appreciation of <i>The Ancient Allan</i> (<font
  class="sc">Cassell</font>) may be measured by my keen disappointment on
  finding that the concluding pages of the book were absent in the copy
  vouchsafed to me, and that (apparently) in their place a double dose of
  pages 279-294 was offered. Nevertheless I can safely assert that you will
  find this a yarn worth reading, for here Sir <font class="sc">Rider
  Haggard</font> is in as good form as ever he was, when both he and
  <i>Allan Quatermain</i> were younger. <i>Lady Ragnall</i>, who is an old
  friend to readers of <i>The Ivory Child</i>, reappears here, having in
  her possession a mysterious and potent herb, which she persuades
  <i>Allan</i> to inhale. Then the fun takes on a great liveliness.
  <i>Allan</i> is wafted back to the days when Egypt was under the
  domination of the Persians, and he in his ancient existence performed
  some of the very doughtiest of deeds. No one living can tell such a tale
  with a greater dexterity and zest than Sir <font class="sc">Rider</font>.
  And at that I will leave it, with one more regret that I was not allowed
  to be present when <i>Allan</i> recovered from the effects of Taduki (the
  herb that did it).</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I find that when the medicine of thought is wrapped up in the jam of
  fiction I generally take both more willingly than either alone. But if my
  author, holding out the spoonful, protests that the jam isn't jam at all
  but part of the dose, then my mouth does not open with quite its usual
  happy confidence. Miss W.M. <font class="sc">Letts</font> has said
  something of the sort about her great little book, <i>Corporal's
  Corner</i> (<font class="sc">Wells, Gardner, Darton</font>), and I wish
  she hadn't. It is cast in the form of letters written by a soldier in
  hospital to a nurse who has been good to him and whose lover has been
  killed at the Front. Miss Letts introduces it with a foreword which
  conveys the impression that a real <i>Corporal Jack</i> wrote these
  letters to a real nurse; but the letters themselves convince&mdash;or
  very nearly convince&mdash;me that the foreword itself is a mere device
  of authorship, and one which defeats its own intention of adding weight
  to the wise and tender and often humorous things the writer has to say.
  From his own death-bed <i>Corporal Jack</i>, together with his own
  love-story and that of his chum <i>Mac</i>, writes what he can of comfort
  to his friend, and whether his hand or Miss <font
  class="sc">Letts's</font> held the pen the book is the work of someone
  who knows all about sorrow, and only the initiated&mdash;who must be many
  for a decade to come&mdash;will know quite how well it is done.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Of the late Mr. <font class="sc">Noel Ross</font>, who, to the
  infinite loss of British journalism, died at the early age of
  twenty-seven, Mr. Punch cannot trust himself to speak with the cold
  detachment of the critic. He saw life with the clear eye of happy youth
  and set it down with the easy pen of a ready writer. Coming from New
  Zealand, through the War, to England, his natural talents were at once
  recognised, and he won a position for himself on the staff of <i>The
  Times</i>. In the leisure moments spared from the service of the Old Lady
  of Printing House Square, he would crack a jest, now and then, with the
  Old Sage of Bouverie Street. Mr. <font class="sc">Edwin Arnold</font> now
  publishes a collection of his writings under the title, <i>Noel Ross and
  His Work</i>, and Mr. Punch confines himself to commending the volume to
  his readers.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
